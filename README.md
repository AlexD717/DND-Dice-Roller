# DnD-Dice-Roller
Rolls your D&D character stats millions of times, giving you the best result.

## Results
Speed Summary (For 1 million stat rolls):
Python ~9.8
Go ~850 ms
Go (multithread) ~not yet implemented

## Why am I doing this
I already have a Python script that performs this task, but it's fairly slow, taking around 9.8 seconds to process a million roles. This time, I am using Go and leveraging multithreading to make it incredibly fast.
